This script is for creating a 3D plot of a crystal structure based on data read from two text files: one containing information about atoms and the other about bonds.

The program is divided into three main parts:

1. **Reading Atom and Bond Data**: The functions `read_atom_data` and `read_bond_data` are used for reading data about atoms and bonds from text files. Both files are assumed to have their data structured as tab-separated values. 

    - The `read_atom_data` function reads a file where each line is expected to contain the x, y, z coordinates of the atom, the RGB color values, the atom radius, and the atom label. The first line of the file is expected to contain the axis ratio for the plot. This function returns arrays containing atom positions, colors, radii, labels, and the axis ratio.

    - The `read_bond_data` function reads a file where each line contains the indices of two atoms that share a bond, the RGB color of the bond, and the bond thickness. This function returns arrays containing bond indices, colors, and thicknesses.

2. **Plotting the Crystal Structure**: The `plot_crystal_structure` function takes the atom and bond data and plots a 3D crystal structure using matplotlib. Atoms are represented as points with their specified colors and sizes, bonds are represented as lines between atoms, and optional labels can be added to atoms. The view angle and light source direction for the plot are set manually, and the axis ratio can be adjusted if provided. The axes and axis labels are hidden to focus on the structure.

3. **Main Program**: The main part of the program specifies the filenames for the atom and bond data, reads these files using the functions defined above, and then calls the plotting function to display the crystal structure. The variable `show_labels` can be set to `True` or `False` to control whether atom labels are displayed.

Overall, this script would be useful for visualizing complex crystal structures in a clear and customizable manner.
