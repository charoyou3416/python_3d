The code seems well structured and there don't appear to be any immediate bugs that would prevent the code from running, assuming that the input files are formatted as expected. However, there are a few potential points for error or improvement:

1. **File Format Assumptions**: The functions `read_atom_data` and `read_bond_data` both assume that the input files are formatted in a specific way. If the files don't have the expected format (e.g., if they don't use tab-separated values, or if a line has fewer values than expected), the program could crash with an error. To make the program more robust, you could add error checking to ensure that each line has the expected number of values, and possibly give a meaningful error message if the file format is incorrect.

2. **Hardcoded File Names**: The filenames for the atom and bond data are hardcoded in the main part of the program. If you wanted to read data from different files, you would have to manually change the filenames in the code. To make the program more flexible, you could make these filenames command-line arguments, so that you can easily use different files without modifying the code.

3. **Setting Axis Ratio**: In the main part of the program, the line `axis_ratio = axis_ratio` is redundant and doesn't do anything. It seems like the intention was to set the axis ratio for the plot, but since the `axis_ratio` variable is not changed after being returned from `read_atom_data`, this line is not needed.

4. **Light Source Adjustment**: The line `ax.azim = 45` is intended to adjust the light source direction. However, `ax.azim` is actually the azimuthal viewing angle, not the light source direction. Matplotlib does not have a built-in light source direction setting. If you want to add lighting effects, you may need to use more advanced techniques or libraries.

5. **Atom and Bond Data Indexing**: In the `plot_crystal_structure` function, there are checks to see if the index `i` is less than the length of `bond_colors` and `bond_thicknesses` when plotting bonds. However, there are no such checks when accessing atom data, and it's assumed that the bond indices refer to valid atoms. If a bond index refers to a non-existent atom, the program could crash with an index error. If there's a risk of this happening, you could add checks to ensure that bond indices refer to valid atoms.

6. **Label Color**: Atom labels are always drawn in black (`color='k'`). If an atom color is dark, the label might not be visible. Depending on the range of atom colors, you might want to choose a label color that contrasts with the atom color, or make the label color customizable.
